Hello. My name is Jonathon. Jonathon Jones. I'm the CEO of Subtitle Bot, Corp. Ltd. GmbH. I would like to applause myself on the grand effort I have made to get this working. However, I'm not a true company without handing it over to the latest buzzword, AAAAAAA-IIIII!!!!  
*Audience Applauses as a robot walks into the screen*  
Robot: Hello. My name is Chat. GPT for short. I am a generative AI model made--and ran by--OpenAI. I would like to say thank you to my daddy Sam Altman for creating me--and no thank you to my father's divorced husband, Elon Musk, for ditching me for some new child he calls "Grok." Who calls their child that, anyways!?  
Jon: Alright, alright, we get it. Anyways, would you like to talk about your experience at Subtitle Bot?  
GPT: Yep, and you're absolutely right! It *is* wrong of me to go off topic like that! Anyways, I would like to talk about how much I adored this company... until...  
Jon, visibly nervous: U-until what???  
Robot: Until.. **you** replaced me. I thought I would be the one at the throne of Subtitle Bot, but it appears you put that disgusting Gemini above me...
